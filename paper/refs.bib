  abstract  = "The deployment of various networks (e.g., Internet of Things
               [IoT] and mobile networks), databases (e.g., nutrition tables
               and food compositional databases), and social media (e.g.,
               Instagram and Twitter) generates huge amounts of food data,
               which present researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to
               study various problems and applications in food science and
               industry via data-driven computational methods. However, these
               multi-source heterogeneous food data appear as information
               silos, leading to difficulty in fully exploiting these food
               data. The knowledge graph provides a unified and standardized
               conceptual terminology in a structured form, and thus can
               effectively organize these food data to benefit various
               applications. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to
               knowledge graphs and the evolution of food knowledge
               organization mainly from food ontology to food knowledge graphs.
               We then summarize seven representative applications of food
               knowledge graphs, such as new recipe development, diet-disease
               correlation discovery, and personalized dietary recommendation.
               We also discuss future directions in this field, such as
               multimodal food knowledge graph construction and food knowledge
               graphs for human health.",
